# TokenTool 2.x
A Token creation tool to create png images suitable for Virtual Table Tops.

Rewritten in JavaFX to bring a modern and updated UI as well as a few new features! TokenTool 2.x now supports PSD format for 'overlays' to allow for better masking by supporting 'layers'. To create your own 'overlay' you can use any version of PhotoShop or GIMP and add your masking layer as the first (bottom) layer and your overlay image as the second (top) layer.

You can add background images, extract images from PDF files, and save the portrait alongside the token using the same background image and/or colors! Several bug fixes and requested enhancements have also been added since 2.0.

Newly built using the latest JDK (16+) and using GitHub actions for Continuous Integration & Deployment!
